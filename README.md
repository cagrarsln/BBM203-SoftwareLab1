## üìÅ Projects Overview

### üîπ [Project 1: KD-Tree & k-Nearest Neighbors](./Project1-KDTree-kNN)

A spatial data management system that models sectors in space using:

- **KD-Tree** for efficient nearest-neighbor searches
- **k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)** classification
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)** and **Left-Leaning Red-Black Tree (LLRBT)** for sector storage

The project emphasizes advanced data structures and algorithmic thinking in C++.

### üîπ [Project 2: Network Stack Simulation](./Project2-NetworkStackSimulation)

A layered simulation of data transmission over a network. The implementation includes:

- Application, Transport, Network, and Physical Layer classes
- A step-by-step encapsulation of data packets through these layers
- Logging of all data movements and transformations

This project demonstrates understanding of computer networking principles through object-oriented programming.
