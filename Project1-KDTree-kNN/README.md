# BBM203 - Software Laboratory I

This project was developed for the BBM203 Software Lab I course at Hacettepe University. It is written in C++ and demonstrates the use of data structures such as KD-Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Binary Search Trees to organize and query spatial sector data.

## üöÄ Project Summary

The project models space sectors and enables operations such as insertion, deletion, and nearest neighbor queries using:

- **KD-Tree** for spatial indexing and fast search.
- **k-NN** algorithm for finding the nearest sectors.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)** and **Left-Leaning Red-Black Tree (LLRBT)** implementations for efficient sector management.
